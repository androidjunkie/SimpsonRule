This is a project that I started in march of 2020 for math 141 Honors option. I wanted to adapt a program that I wrote in Mathematica
to a program in Python. This program works pretty well so far for estimating the integral of a set of discrete y-values with even steps
of x-values, but currently is having a few hiccups with working with estimating the integral of a function, as Python is a little weird 
about inputting math operators from the command line. There are library(ies) out there that will perform the Simpson's rule integration
supposedly simply, but this is a way for me to improve my familiarity with Python while improving my coding and math skills, so I am 
trying to do without for now. 

Git commit 8 Aug 2020

Added Mathematica code to the repo
